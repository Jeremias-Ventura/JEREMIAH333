# JEREMIAH33:3

A calm, faith-based focus tool that helps you work with intention while staying grounded in Scripture.

## What This Is

JEREMIAH33:3 is a simple, peaceful focus timer paired with Bible verses. It's designed to help you stay present in your work while keeping God's truth in front of you.

The name comes from Jeremiah 33:3: *"Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know."*

## Features

### Focus Timer

Work with intention using a simple, calming countdown timer. It isn't a full Pomodoro system — there are no complex intervals or break cycles. Instead, it's designed to be peaceful and distraction-free, giving you space to breathe, focus, and stay present in your work.

### Bible Verse

Stay encouraged as you work with Scripture displayed beside the timer. A new verse appears every 5 minutes to refresh your motivation and refocus your mind on God's truth. If you ever want additional encouragement, you can generate a new verse at any time with a single click.
